<title>KlayGE Packing System</title>

<body>
<h1>Packing system in KlayGE</h1>
<p>From KlayGE 3.6, packing system employed 7zip as packing format. Before using it, make sure that 7z.dll from 7zip is in your system.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>KlayGE's packing system can be used unifiedly via ResLoader. The naming rules is seperate outside path and inside path by &quot;//&quot;. If a package has password, add &quot;|&quot; and the password after is outside path. For example, if there's a package <em>folder/example.7z</em>, which has a password <em>abcd</em>. A file's inside path is ex1/ex2/test.cpp, then it's full path is:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>folder/example.7z|abcd//ex1/ex2/test.cpp</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>though this path, ResLoader can load and decompress this file from the package to a std::istream object.</p>
