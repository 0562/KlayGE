<h1>KlayGE wishlist</h1>
<p>This is a list of suggested additions for the further versions of KlayGE.</p>
<p>This list is intended as a stimulus to further work. Some of the items on this list already have one or more concrete proposals associated with them, others are vague hopes, and most are somewhere in between. Similarly, the scope of these items extend from minor changes in an existing interface to major research projects.</p>
<h2>The wish list</h2>
<h3>Deferred shading (showed as a sample in 3.8.0) </h3>
<p>Deferred shadig based rendering with anti-alias and transparency.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Depth peeling (showed in 3.7.0) </h3>
<p>Order-independent transparency.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Vector texture mapping</h3>
<p>Support texture stores vectors in texels. A font engine can be built on top of it. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Software rendering plugin</h3>
<p>D3D10-like software rendering plugin. Support all parts in D3D10+ with pure software. </p>
<hr />
<h3>UI editor</h3>
<p>WYSIWYG UI editor. UI layout can be exported as xml file. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Terrain rendering </h3>
<p>Large scale terrain rendering. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Get rid of DirectShow </h3>
<p>Replay video/audio without DirectShow. One option is take .ogm as container format, Theora as video codec, and Vorbis as audio codec. Subtitle is also supported.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Physics &amp; math on GPU</h3>
<p><strong>Requester: </strong>Ye Wu</p>
<p>Physics simulation, basic linear algebra with GPGPU. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Realtime global illumination</h3>
<p><strong>Requester: </strong>Ye Wu </p>
<p>Global illumination in realtime. Shadow, refraction, reflection, translucency and bounces are supported. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Powerful memory manager </h3>
<p>Support memory allocation/deallocation cross DLL boundaries, leak detection, and pool. Better to be Lock-free or wait-free.</p>
<hr />
<h3>GPU based tessellator </h3>
<p>Support hardware tessellation on D3D11/D3D10 (ATI), shader based tessellation on D3D9/OpenGL.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Screen space ambient occlusion (showed as a sample in 3.8.0) </h3>
<p>Use SSAO to add details in dard places. </p>
<hr />
<h3>GPU audio process </h3>
<p>Process audio (3D, effect) by GPU and send raw data to audio card. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Command buffer recording and replaying </h3>
<p>Capture all DX/OGL API calls in a thread and replay the buffer in other threads. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Mobile support</h3>
<p> OpenGL ES 2.0 plugin and D3D mobile plugin.</p>
<hr />
